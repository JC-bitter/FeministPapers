《MeToo展前言》
## #MeToo：失语者的抗争
## ——从诉说中战胜恐惧


人类历史上最大规模的屠杀是房思琪式的强暴。

已离世的台湾作家林奕含生前接受采访曾如此形容性侵害。她说，性侵害，现在，此刻，也正在发生，会持续发生。

如她书中的房思琪一般，遭受性侵害后，人们或自责，或羞愧，或悲痛，或愤怒，或迷茫，或自欺欺人。沉默、隐忍，如失语者在孤岛里无助徘徊，被伤害与黑暗吞没。

直到2018年元旦第一天，北京航天航天大学博士毕业生罗茜茜打破沉默，实名控诉12年前遭受的性骚扰，她失眠、幻听，她得了抑郁症。但她说，不能让黑暗与无力继续蔓延，伤害更多的人。

黑暗被撕开，微光透进来。曾经的失语者获得了诉说的力量，即便这些诉说每每被删帖，#Me Too蜕变成“米兔”。从罗茜茜开始，更多故事被说了出来：已经离世的高岩，被教师性侵的小柔，被“乙肝斗士”侵害的花花，跳楼的李奕奕，醉酒后被强暴的小精灵，被名主持人性骚扰的弦子……无数的讲述和呐喊如点点星光，曝出房间里的大象。盛世之下，那么多人却遭受着持续发生却被视而不见的侵害，从骚扰到强暴，性侵害是最难以启齿、最难以置信、最无法得到公道的侵害。

幸好，故事连接人心，经验彼此温暖，我们不是孤岛，一声“我也是”,有万千回响。

走过迷茫、屈辱和怀疑之路，失语者汇聚成诉说者，从诉说中自我赋权、相互增能。从诉说中集结同道、教育社会。这里，是这场克服恐惧的众人之旅的缩影——私人物品，讲述着屈辱或战胜屈辱的一刻；心路日记，直面彼时的痛楚；影像制品，见证曾经的挣扎和抗争；持续寄信，用坚持打破无力感；诉诸法律，为司法正义增添新的铺路石……

这个#MeToo展是无数“我也是”的点滴证词，是“米兔”漫漫长路的一段历程，是受害者行动的真人图书馆，是幸存者倡导的集体亮相平台。

揭开那些最沉痛最真切的生命创伤，走向一场集体疗愈。


 
#MeToo in China Exhibition: Speak Out, Conquer Fear


“The largest massacre in human history is the ongoing rape of women.”

The Taiwanese writer Lin Yihan once described sexual assault in this way. She claimed that it is happening here and now and will continue to happen.

After suffering from sexual assault, survivors may self-blame, feel shame, grief, anger, lost, and self-deceive. They can feel like voiceless souls wandering on isolated islands, overwhelmed by harm and darkness. 

It was not until New Year’s Day of 2018, when Luo Xixi, a PhD graduate from Beihang University broke the silence. She accused her professor of sexual harassment 12 years ago. She suffered insomnia, auditory hallucination and depression since then. But she said, we cannot let darkness and powerlessness spread and hurt more people. 

When darkness is torn, a small light comes in. Those who once lost their voices begin to gain the power of telling, even if those stories and words are continuously censored. Starting from Luo Xixi, numerous stories have exposed prevalent but hidden crimes. Among all the offences, sexual violence is the kind that is most shameful and most disbelieved and is most difficult to get justice for.

Fortunately, the stories link people together, and our similar experiences warm each other. One shout of “Me Too”, creates thousands of echoes. We are not isolated.

Recovering from all the loss, shame and misgivings they’ve been through, those who were once voiceless come together and speak out. By telling stories, they empower themselves, build up strength and educate the public. This exhibition demonstrates the long-struggling journey of all the survivors. There are personal belongings that have borne witness to moments of shame or defeat, diaries that recorded pain, and videos that document past struggles. Over 350 letters showcase perseverance, as well as all the legal documents used to fight for justice. 

This #MeToo exhibition gathers the evidence bit by bit. It is a song of praise for all the survivors, and their activism. By revealing the deepest and truest traumas in life, it will lead to collective healing.
